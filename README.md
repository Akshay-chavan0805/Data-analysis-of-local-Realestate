# Data_analysis_with_R
I developed a system to help people decide whether to invest in real estate by predicting the probability of a successful sale. I used machine learning techniques like logistic regression, LDA, and KNN to analyze data from Kaggle, a popular platform for data experts. I dealt with data issues like missing values and outliers using visualization tools in R. I found that logistic regression is great for straight-line scenarios, while KNN is better for complex ones. Also, I studied factors affecting real estate prices, like policies and the economy, to build a precise price prediction model.
